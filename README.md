# Probe-my-Pathway

This is a project I did during my MSc, where I mapped chemical tools (compounds used in biochemical/cellular assays to study protein function) onto human biological pathways. The purpose of this project was to identify areas in human biology that are lacking chemical tool development. Here are links to two first-author papers that I published detailing the project ([paper 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644624002691), [paper 2](https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baae116/7917298?login=false)). Also, my past colleagues and I developed the [PmP database](https://apps.thesgc.org/pmp/) for open-access to the data.

I initially did this project using the ICM (Molsoft, San Francisco) command line language, but I thought it would be a good practice to replicate the project in SQL.
